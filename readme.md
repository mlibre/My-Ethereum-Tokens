# My Ethereum Tokens

There are currently a large number of ERC tokens in Ethereum. Keeping track of what you have is a bit hard.  
`MET` is a simple project that explores the last N blocks in order to find active tokens. It then checks if the wallet address you provided has any balance on these tokens.
